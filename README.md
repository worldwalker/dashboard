## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Go to [http://localhost:3000/dashboard](http://localhost:3000/dashboard) to visit dashboard page.
Go to [http://localhost:3000/robot](http://localhost:3000/robot) to check our autonomous robot.
And go to [http://localhost:3000/item](http://localhost:3000/item) which is app's landing page to visit a random item's detail page.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
